description: 'REFRACTION - [see blog post for info] Megan Suttles/Eric TollefsonRefraction is a site-specific work with tensional relationships stemming from multiple origins that seeks to define a space architecturally by combining one space into another. Through the juxtaposition and repetition of two unlikely materials, monofilament and silver leaf, the materiality of each is masked and transformed.'
